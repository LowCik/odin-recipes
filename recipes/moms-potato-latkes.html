        <h1>Mom's Potato Latkes</h1>
        <p>Latkes (potato pancakes) are a must-have at Hanukkah,
             but are really wonderful any time of the year!
              This is my mother's recipe, which is honestly
               the best potato latke I've had. I usually end up making a 
               second batch because they disappear so quickly. I've tried 
               other recipes and always return to this one. Lovely topped 
               with sour cream or applesauce.</p>
